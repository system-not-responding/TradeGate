# TradeGate Program
## Description
TradeGate is a simple Python program designed to provide basic statistics for traders including risk, reward, and risk-to-reward ratio calculations. It also provides trade advice based on user inputs meeting certain conditions.
## Dependencies
Python 3.11.3
## Installation
No installation is required. You only need to have Python installed.
## Usage
You can start the program with the main function and follow the prompt instructions. It will ask for different inputs related to your trade such as the dollar amount per tick, the Average True Range (ATR), the number of ticks in the reward, the number of contracts, and your portfolio balance.
The program will calculate and print the risk, reward, risk-to-reward ratio, round to two decimal places, and other statistics based on the user inputs. Furthermore, it will provide trade advice if the risk doesn't exceed a certain threshold and if the risk-to-reward meets a minimum requirement.
